- you are required to design and implement a client-server based chat 
application that makes use of TCP sockets.

- You need to specify your own application
layer protocol to support the client-server architecture, and then implement a chat server
that will manage the interaction between chatting clients.

- You should also implement a
chat client that will allow one or more pairs of users to run on different hosts and exchange
messages in real-time.

- The clientâ€™s interface can be in terminal, with appropriate user
menus. However, a GUI will be nice to have.

- In this assignment, you are to design a chat
application that takes into consideration at least two constraints; limited bandwidth,
and any other constraint of your choosing.

- With respect to bandwidth, you need to
implement the application such that for media file transmissions, the recipient has the
option of accepting or declining the receiving of a file.

- The last aspect of the protocol design will be the communication rules that specify the
sequence of messages at every stage of communication. This requires clearly specifying
messages and reactions for every communication scenario. You will need to represent
such rules with sequence diagrams and state diagrams.
